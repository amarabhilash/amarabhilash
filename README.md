Hi,there!





🎓 I am Tapajyoti Bose, a Front End Web Developer (specializing in React Applications) and a Top Rated Freelancer on Upwork. I am also Pursuing my Bachelor in Computer Science & Engineering and will graduate in mid-2022.

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and have contributed to several Gigantic Organizations including, Material UI, Microsoft, Amazon, Webhint, and countless others. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2021, I learned Next.js, Progressive Web App (PWA), GraphQL, Micro-Frontend Architecture and Blockchain development & DApps. I got started with Freelancing and Blogging quite recently and made a name for myself.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from guitar, break dancing (hip-hop), sketching, and touch typing to some whacky ones like writing with my left hand.

📚 I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy in the genre of personal development and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy.

✈️ I love traveling too. I have been on solo trips to Bhutan in 2018 and to Hyderabad, India in 2021.
